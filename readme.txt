Set the default date and time when you create a new post.

== Description ==

When you create a new post in WordPress, the publish date is set to 'immediately', this plugin allows you more control over this behaviour and set a date or time of your choosing.

For example, you can choose to have new posts scheduled for:

* first Tuesday of next month at 5:30pm
* next Monday at 09:00
* Friday at 19:30

Any format that PHP's (strtotime)[http://php.net/manual/en/datetime.formats.php] function can understand can be used.

Settings are on a per user basis, just go to your profile page!

This code is released under the GPL v2, see license.txt for details.

== Installation ==

1. Extract the archive file into your plugins directory in the default-post-datetime folder.
2. Activate the plugin in the Plugin options.
3. Customize the settings from the the Your Profile page, if desired.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I'm formatting a date/time that seems to be valid and works but when I hit the validate button it says its wrong? =

The validate button uses JavaScript to do it's work and JavaScript does not have a strtotime() function and so not all cases may be supported.  If the configuration you have set is working as you expect you can safely ignore the validation errors.

= Can I use non-English words in the date/time fields? =

No, strtotime() does not support internationalization and therefore neither does this plugin.
